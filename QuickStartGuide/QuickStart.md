## Preconditions
- You should have a cloned empty project repo or you need to create new one
- You should have installed Xcode
- You should have access to Project Developer Team to be able working with certificates, identifiers & profiles.

## Overview
1. [Set up Git](#Set-up-Git)
1. [Copy Template Project](#Copy-Template-Project)
1. [Replace copyrights](#Replace-Copyrights)

## Set up Git
- Set up [git user](https://github.com/effectiveband/Collaboration-Guidelines/blob/master/VersionControl.md#prepare-account)
- Configure [git workflow](https://www.notion.so/effectiveband/iOS-Effective-Branching-Model-2fb7b4ed83c54cf49b5b36a3f5fa108e)
    - You should have main and develop branches
    - You should use feature branch and PRs for changing codebase 

## Copy Template Project

- Download `TemplateProject` from [here](./TemplateProject.zip)
- Unzip archive
- Put content of `TemplateProject` folder to git repo

## Replace Copyrights
You can use any text editor.

Open root project folder in text editor and replace string:
```
//  Copyright Â© 2021 Krasavchik OOO. All rights reserved.
```
to:
```
//  Copyright Â© 2021 YouCompanyName. All rights reserved.
```

## Configure Project

Open project file `App.xcodeproj`.

### Build Configurations

There are 4 [xcconfig files](https://nshipster.com/xcconfig/) in folder `App/xcconfigs` that allow to adjust build parameters.

- Debug.xcconfig
  
  It'used within `AppDevelopment` scheme for Run, Test and Analyze actions. Think of it as local development config.

- QaRelease.xcconfig
  
  It'used within `AppDevelopment` scheme for Profile and Archive actions. Think of it as config for QA builds.

- DebugProduction.xcconfig

  It'used within `AppProduction` scheme for Run, Test and Analyze actions. Think of it as config for debugging production builds.

- ProductionRelease.xcconfig

  It'used within `AppProduction` scheme for Profile and Archive actions. Think of it as config for release build for production.

### Set Build Configs

*You can extend any build config values via `xcconfig`. Use [documentation]((https://nshipster.com/xcconfig/)) for deep diving into it.*

Example of debug config:
  ```
//--------------------
// App settings
//--------------------
APP_DISPLAY_NAME = App (Debug)
APP_BUILD_TYPE = debug // production, qa

APP_API_STAGING = https:/$()/api.apptemplate.effective.band
APP_API_PRODUCTION = https:/$()/api.apptemplate.effective.band

//--------------------
// Override settings
//--------------------
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = band.effective.apptemplate
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = JVX7U43WRX

SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = $(inherited) FLEX_ENABLED
```

There are two sections in config:
- custom build settings
- overidden existing build settings

So, you need to provide
- `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` - Name of application displayed on home screen
- `APP_BUILD_TYPE` - Build type in terms of debug/qa/production
- `APP_API_STAGING` - Base url for staging API
- `APP_API_PRODUCTION` - Base url for production API
- `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` - Application bundle id
- `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` - Development team id which is used for automatic code signing. You can find it on Membership page of Apple Developer Console (for instance).
- `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` - Custom compilation conditions.

Save files changes.

Allow xcode to finish updating project and that's it. 

Your project is ready for development! ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to remove any components you don't need for your project.

## Project Examples

Get familiar with project examples to reuse code base and ideas, follow guidelines.

Project consist of some modules. You can read more details in [Architecture](../Docs/Architecture.md) page.

### Providing Components

There is `AppContainer.swift` in App module to store dependency graph and provide specific depdendecies

### Asynchronous Approach

The most API of components uses Function Reactive Programming (FRP) concept based on iOS Combine framework but some of components still uses old good callback-based api as well.

### Networking

Use `AlamofireHttpClient` for making http requests. It's based on Alamofire library.

API implementation is stored in `AppServices` module.
Use `HttpRequestFactory` for building requests. Also you can find here examples for core network resonse models, network mapping, alamofire authenticator, network error model.

### Data Layer

Repository pattern is used for making abstraction for access data. You can take a look at `AccountRepository` for details.

### Logging

Use app loggers provided by LoggerFactory. [os logging](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging) is used as implementation.

### Debug Menu

There is added debug menu in the app. You can open it by swiping from right side on any screen.

You can define any content you'd like. Extend `DebugView.swift` or implement new and provide for `InAppDebugger`.

Currenlty you can
- Switch API environments.
- Manage local debug toggles
- Show App Color Pallete
- Do force logout. You still need to implement API calls

Also you'll find here examples for ui components.

### DevTools

There is folder in app module with developer tools. Debug menu is one of them. There are also
- `FakeAuthService` used to fake auth process
- `DebugTogglesHolder` for managing local debug feature on device. 

  *Use case 1: you can use feature toggle to run only flow you wokring on and you don't need to go through whole app to get screen you need to make.*
  
  *Use case 2: you didn't finish feature yet but you'd like to merge changes to dev branch. So you can use feature toggle to disable feature and not break other features.*

  More info for inspiration: https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html

- `StubFlowCoordinator` for rapid prototying and adding stubs
- Demo screens like color pallete, ui compoments.

### Dependency Management

Recomentations:
- Use Swift Package Manager as primary DM

Specific 3rd party dependencies is described in [README Initial setup section](../README.md#Initial-setup)

### Support Tools

- [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) is used to enforce Swift style and conventions.

  `.swiftlint.yml` config can be found in XcodeProject folder. Binary executable file is add to repo (`Tools` folder)

- [.gitignore](../.gitignore) file to manage git tracking.

- [GitHub Pull Request Template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to keep the unified style for PRs
  [More info on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
  
### Screen Navigation

Coordinator idea is used for managing user flow. 

Examples of flows (Welcome, Signup, HomeFlow) is placed in Flow module in `AppModulesPackage`.

`AppCoordinator.swift` is root coordinator that manage top level flows.

Current implementation is based on [this example](https://medium.com/blacklane-engineering/coordinators-essential-tutorial-part-i-376c836e9ba7)

### Building Screen

MVVM pattern is used for presentation layer. 
- `Context` file containing view events, view states, screen output events and screen errors.
- `Content view` file where screen layout is defined
- `View Controller` file where view binding and rendering states are defined
- `ViewModel` file where presentation logic lives. View Model use interactors, app services or repositories to access data and running actions. Also ViewModel sends screen output event.


### Project README

Read Project [README](../README.md) and use it as template for main project documentation by filling TBD section for specific you project.
